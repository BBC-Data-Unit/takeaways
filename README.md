In October 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45875294) UK high streets had the highest concentration of fast food outlets since 2010.

Research suggests people most exposed to them are nearly twice as likely to be obese.

We analysed the latest business figures with population estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and found:

- The UK had seen a 34% increase in fast food outlets from 2010 to 2018
- In 2010, the average number of fast food outlets per 100,000 people was 47. It had risen to 61 by 2018
- In nearly every area (204 out of 215) the rate of takeaways per 100,000 people was higher in 2018 than 2010
